# A Full-Stack Todo List Application
This application allows users to manage tasks (todos) in an efficient way. It implements a <b>RESTful API</b> for the backend using <b>Express</b> as mock backend, which interacts with a <b>PostgreSQL</b> database for storing tasks. The frontend is built using React, enabling users to easily add, edit, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks.

# Features (Towards both client & server side):
- Create: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Read: Users can view all the tasks.
- Update: Users can edit existing tasks to update their descriptions.
- Delete: Users can remove tasks from the to-do list.
